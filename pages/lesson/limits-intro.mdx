Limits allow us to talk about what happens as we approach a point on a function,
while this may seem random the idea of a limit is one of the foundational pillars of calculus.

The idea is there are some pesky functions like $f(x) = (2x + x^2)/x$ which aren't defined somewhere,
in this case $f(0)$ is not defined because it would cause division by zero.

Let's look at the graph

<Mafs>
  <CartesianCoordinates />
  <FunctionGraph.OfX y={(x) => (2 * x + x ** 2) / x} />
  <Point x={0} y={2} />
</Mafs>

I've marked the problem point, we can't divide by zero! yet it's almost as if $f(x)$ is begging us to make it two at zero.
We can divide by $x$ to get

$$
f(x) = (2x + x^2)/x = 2 + x
$$

Now obviously if we plug in $x = 0$ we'll get $2$ as desired, then we'd divide by zero!
The solution is to say _as $x$ approaches two, $f(x)$ approaches zero_.

What does that mean? It means however close to $2$ I want you to get, you can find an $x$ close to zero that satisfies my request.

For example: If I wanted to get within $0.01$ of $2$ you might pick $x = 0.001$.
_No matter how close I want to get, you can get me that close_
