The power rule states that

$$
\frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1}
$$

To take a simple example consider $x^1$, according to this law the derivative is $1x^0 = 1$ which it is!
To see why the power rule is true consider the limit definition of a derivative

$$
\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(x+h)^n - x^n}{h}
$$

We can expand $(x+h)^n$ using the binomial theorem

$$
\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(x^n + nx^{n-1}h + h^2(\dots)) - x^n}{h}
= \lim_{h \to 0} nx^{n-1} + h(\dots)
$$

Therefor the derivative is $nx^{n-1}$
