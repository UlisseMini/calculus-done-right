The derivative is _linear_. Which makes sense if you think in terms of rates of change.
Linearity means the rate of change of of a sum is the sum of the rates of change. Symbolically

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left(f(x) + g(x)\right) = \frac{d}{dx}f(x) + \frac{d}{dx}g(x)
$$

The second bit of linearity is that you can bring the constant outside

$$
\frac{d}{dx} cf(x) = c \frac{d}{dx} f(x)
$$

The important thing is this making sense intuitively, the proof isn't important but I'll present it for completeness.
The trick is using the fact that limits are linear

$$
\begin{aligned}
(cf)'
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{c f(x+h) - c f(x)}{h} \\
&= c\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \\
&= cf'(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

And for the sum case (don't be afraid! it's just algebra!)

$$
\begin{aligned}
(f + g)'(x)
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(f + g)(x+h) - (f + g)(x)}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) + g(x+h) - f(x) - g(x)}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} + \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h} \\
&= f'(x) + g'(x)
\end{aligned}
$$
