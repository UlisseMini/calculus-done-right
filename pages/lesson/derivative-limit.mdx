The derivative of a function $f$ at $x$ (denoted $f'(x)$) is defined as

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

There are many ways to think of this, one is to think of the tangent line to $f$

An example: The derivative of $x^2$ being $2x$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(x+h)^2 - x^2}{h}
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(x^2 + 2xh + h^2) - x^2}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2xh + h^2}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0}\left(2x + h\right) \\
&= 2x
\end{aligned}
$$
