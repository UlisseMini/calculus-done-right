## The problem

Calculus (in school) is currently taught extremely inefficiently. There are people like [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) and [betterexplained](https://betterexplained.com/calculus/) addressing this but they only cover calculus intuition. They can't be used as a full course substitute.

On top of that Spaced Repetition Software (SRS) isn't used, making it needlessly hard to remember the content learned. SRS acts as an I/O layer to the brain, done properly it can drastically cut learning time and make what you retain permanent.

## Calculus done right

My goal is to make something like [wanikani](https://www.wanikani.com/) for calculus (and eventually other math).
Gamifying progress tracking with spaced repetition and quizes to make sure you retain everything.

My primary goal is teaching someone all the fundemental calculus ideas and showing how they can be applied to problems.
This includes proofs of derivative laws, integration techniques etc.

I'm going to focus on intuition and deep understanding before computation-drilling,
since I don't have many ideas for making computational drills more efficient. (I have some, but they're hard to implement)

## Khan Academy

[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab) is currently the best full course but they're crippled by following AP's ridiculous ordering, they don't have true SRS and they don't use the best explanations. Compare this [convoluted proof](https://youtu.be/R0EQg9vgbQw) of the angle addition identity to the elegant [complex multiplication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PcpBw5Hbwo) version that allows you to re-derive it in your head!

## Brilliant

[Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/calculus/) has great calculus courses, however they don't do SRS and they don't do enough computations to prepare you for a test.

Personally I feel brilliant overdoes the gamification to the point that it harms learning by not forcing you to review old concepts.
